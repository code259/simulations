# Computational Neuroengineering Simulations

Welcome to the **Computational Neuroengineering Simulations** repository â€” a collection of physics-based simulation projects aimed at solving real-world problems in neurotechnology and neural engineering.

---

## About This Repository

This repository hosts multiple independent yet related simulation projects that use computational modeling and finite element analysis (FEM) to study phenomena relevant to neural engineering. The projects cover topics ranging from heat transfer in brain tissue to electrical stimulation modeling and mechanical interactions between neural implants and tissue.

Each project is self-contained with its own setup, parameters, and output files, and all are built using Python-based open-source FEM frameworks such as FEniCSx.

## Projects Overview

### 1. Heat Transfer Around Neural Electrodes  
- **Description:** Simulates transient heat diffusion in brain tissue caused by neural recording electrodes during operation.  
- **Highlights:** Models localized heat generation with realistic brain tissue properties. Useful for assessing thermal safety and electrode design.  
- **Location:** `/heat_transfer_electrode/`  
- **README:** [Heat Transfer README](heat_transfer_electrode/README.md)

### 2. Electrical Field Distribution in Cortical Tissue  
- **Description:** Simulates electrical potential distribution generated by implanted electrodes stimulating neural tissue.  
- **Location:** `/electrical_stimulation/`  
- **README:** [Electrical Stimulation README](electrical_stimulation/README.md)

### 3. Mechanical Interaction of Electrodes with Brain Tissue  
- **Description:** Models deformation and mechanical stresses in brain tissue due to electrode insertion and micromotion.  
- **Location:** `/mechanical_interaction/`  
- **README:** [Mechanical Interaction README](mechanical_interaction/README.md)

*(More projects coming soon!)*
